This is a project that is based of the game Tetris. The objective of the game is to stack blocks and create lines horizontally in order
to get points.

We wish to have this project be seen as useful in the sense that it creates joy in those who play the game and allow for players
to enjoy themselves casually or play it more seriously by trying and going for high scores.

In order to get play the game, clone the repository and type in

```
./mvnw javafx:run
```

The default controls of the game are as follows
```
Move Left - Left Arrow
Move Right - Right Arrow
Move Down - Down Arrow
Hard Drop - Spacebar

Rotate Clockwise - Z
Rotate Anticlockwise - X

Hold - C

Pause - Esc
```

In order to get started by contributing the file, make sure to fork the repository and clone onto your own PC. This
project relies on Java 17, JavaFX and the Maven wrapper as the build tool.
